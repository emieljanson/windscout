# Windpeek firmware

Windpeek is an 800 x 480 wind forecast dashboard for the Seeed Studio
reTerminal E1001 and E1002. It fetches a five-day forecast directly, caches the
last valid result, renders locally and only refreshes the E-ink panel when the
final bitmap changed.

## Dashboard

- Five days with samples at 08:00, 11:00, 14:00, 17:00 and 20:00 local time.
- Vertical bars show sustained wind; horizontal markers show gusts.
- Arrows point toward the direction the wind travels.
- A fixed 0-40 kt scale makes days directly comparable.
- Fresh, aged, stale and unavailable states remain legible without color.
- Geometry sits on integer pixels; text and arrows pass through one final
  Floyd-Steinberg monochrome dither pass.

## Forecast service

Windpeek uses Open-Meteo directly for wind, weather, temperature and optional
sea-level forecasts. The website installs the spot, timezone and forecast model;
every firmware build uses the same fixed Open-Meteo endpoints.

During USB setup the browser seeds both the device clock and its battery-backed
RTC. Local forecast and wake times use the installed spot's IANA timezone via
the bundled TZDB 2025b rules, including daylight-saving changes and fractional
UTC offsets.

## Empty-battery reserve

On supported Windpeek boards, boot and existing scheduled/button work check
battery voltage before starting network work. There is no battery polling task
and no additional timer wake. At or below 3450 mV, the device attempts one full
black `Battery empty` screen, then deep-sleeps without forecast timer wakes.
The attempt is latched in RTC memory and NVS before refreshing, so a reset or
failed refresh does not repeatedly spend the remaining battery. The panel cache
is invalidated so the forecast is redrawn on recovery.

USB power permits normal operation on the next wake; otherwise recovery needs
at least 3650 mV to avoid restarting on voltage rebound. After charging, press a
wake button if attaching USB did not wake the board. Held buttons are excluded
from critical-sleep wake sources to avoid repeated boots.

These voltage thresholds are provisional engineering reserves, not a calibrated
remaining-capacity guarantee. Validate the last refresh under load on each board,
with aged batteries and low temperatures. A sudden power loss can still prevent
the final refresh; a failed attempt is not retried until recovery. The UI has
native black/white encoding for E1001, E1002, and E1003.

## Build and test

```sh
make test
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1002
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX flash monitor
```

E1002, universal E1001/E1002 and E1003 builds run only the firmware step by
default. Other boards still build the photo-frame webapp and setup screens.
Use `--step` to request individual build steps explicitly.

The E1002 build contains only the Windpeek dashboard, USB installer, Wi-Fi
client, forecast cache and battery/deep-sleep runtime. The upstream photo-frame
UI, albums, captive portal, Home Assistant and photo OTA runtime are excluded.
See `UPSTREAM.md` for origin and license details.
