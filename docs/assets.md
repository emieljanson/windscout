## E1002 product model

The configurator's local product model is derived from Seeed Studio's official shared E1001/E1002 STEP assembly:

- Source: <https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/res/reTerminal_E1001_E1002_3D.stp>
- Product documentation: <https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_reterminal_e1002/>
- Documented enclosure: 176 × 120 × 17 mm; 53 mm deep with stand

Run `npm run model:prepare` from `web/` to download the source into a temporary directory and create the local `public/devices/e1002/e1002.glb` plus `provenance.json`. The converter removes selected internal assembly parts, preserves exterior roles, and adds a measured 800:480 screen plane.

The project owner confirmed direct permission from Seeed Studio to use the CAD file on 26 August 2026. The optimized GLB and its provenance record are therefore included in the public app. Regenerating the model still verifies the pinned source hash, dimensions, scene roles, screen plane, and exported GLB before replacing those files.
